# Arduino Microcontroller
The arduino is a popular, lightweight series of microcontroller. They are able to perform many functions with modules.
This repo contains a handful of programs I have written for the Arduino, specifically the R3 uno, though the programming is typically interchangable.

The Arduino's native language is Wiring/C++
